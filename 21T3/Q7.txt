Assume that this student (zid:5128688) studied 29 subjects over 10 terms. Assume also that the scripts have no errors.

Do these two scripts produce the same output?

Script A
- Get all the terms the student studied
- For each term studied, print the term code and get all subjects
- For each subject, print the subject code and name

Script B
- Get all subjects studied ordered by term and subject code
- Keep a 'prev' variable to keep track of the last term code
- If term code changes, print it and update prev; otherwise, don't print term code

Yes, both scripts produce the same output!

How many times does each script call the execute() method?

Script A:
q1: 1
q2: 10

Script B:
q1: 1

Which script is likely to be faster?

Script B, makes fewer calls to the DB.
